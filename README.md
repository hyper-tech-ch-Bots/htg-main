# Discord Bot Template
This is the default template I use to make most of my Discord Bots. It's OS but please attribute me \:) - You don't have to, but it would be nice if you can also let me know if you've used this template by messaging me on Discord @Ratzifutzi or via e-mail joshua@hyper-tech.ch 

# Prerequisites
